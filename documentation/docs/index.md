# PlayerLevels
PlayerLevels is a leveling and reward system designed for Minecraft server networks.

Most important features:
- Configurable leveling system with XP levels
- Reward system with configurable one-time and recurring rewards
- Server-dependent rewards in a network
- Many management commands for moderators and admins
- Extensive developer API

This plugin is not an all-inclusive drop-in solution for a leveling system.
The plugin was designed for server networks that can integrate this plugin into existing plugins via the API or use plugins that have an integration for this plugin.

By default, there is no way to earn XP as a player. This has to be done by other plugins via the API.
